# 📊 Gaming Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboards
🎮 Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a large gaming dataset, focusing on key trends, player behavior, revenue insights, and other critical metrics. As part of my capstone project, I leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards that provide valuable business intelligence for stakeholders in the gaming industry.

📌 Objectives
Analyze player engagement, retention rates, and spending habits.

Identify key factors influencing game popularity and revenue generation.

Create interactive visualizations using Power BI for actionable insights.

Apply data cleaning, transformation, and advanced analytical techniques.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes information such as:

User Activity (logins, session durations, engagement levels)

Game Performance (player progression, level completion rates)

Revenue Metrics (in-app purchases, subscriptions, advertising)

Demographic Data (age, region, platform preferences)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI (for visualization and dashboards)

Python / Pandas / NumPy (for data preprocessing & analysis)

SQL (for querying and data extraction)

Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis)

📈 Power BI Dashboards
The project features several Power BI dashboards, including:

User Engagement Dashboard: Tracks active users, session times, and retention trends.

Revenue & Monetization Dashboard: Analyzes in-game purchases, subscriptions, and revenue distribution.

Game Performance Insights: Shows level completion rates, player progression, and difficulty analysis.

🚀 Key Findings & Insights
Players from Region X had the highest in-game purchases.

Engagement peaks during weekends and holidays.

Certain in-game items contributed to a significant revenue boost.

High churn rates in specific game levels indicate possible difficulty spikes.

📊 Future Improvements
Integrating machine learning to predict player churn.

Enhancing real-time data processing for live dashboards.

Expanding analysis to include social interactions and multiplayer trends.
